##  🏥 Breast Cancer Dataset: A Simple Introduction 

👋 This dataset is a hypothetical representation of 200 breast cancer patients, designed for learning purposes. 💡 It includes relevant information like age, tumor size, lymph node involvement, and treatment, along with the diagnosis of breast cancer (yes or no). 

**📊 What's in the Data?**

* 👴 age: Age of the patient at diagnosis (in years) 
* 👵 menopause: Menopausal status (premeno, lt40, ge40) 
* 📏 tumor_size: Size of the tumor (in mm) 
* 📍 inv_nodes: Number of involved lymph nodes 
* 🛡️ node_caps: Presence of node capsular invasion (yes/no) 
* 🧬 deg_malig: Degree of malignancy (1-3) 
* 左右 breast: Breast affected (left/right) 
* 🧭 breast_quad: Quadrant of the breast where the tumor is located (left_up, left_low, right_up, right_low) 
* ☢️ irradiat: Whether the patient received radiation therapy (yes/no) 
* 🎗️ target: The outcome variable - whether the patient has breast cancer (1) or not (0) 

**⚠️ Important Notes:**

* 🤔 This is not real patient data and should not be used for medical decision-making. It's a simplified representation for learning purposes. 
* 🤖 Categorical features are encoded using one-hot encoding, which means each unique category value gets its own binary column. 
* 🧮 This dataset is set up for running a linear regression model, but remember that breast cancer diagnosis is a classification problem.  
* This dataset is an inspiration from cdc and kaggle. I then used LLM's to make a clean dataset for project purposes.
* Example: https://github.com/NanditaA/ML-Supervised-Classification/blob/master/README.md 

**🚀 How to Use This Dataset:** 

* 💻 Practice Linear Regression: Build and evaluate a linear regression model to predict the probability of breast cancer diagnosis based on the given features. 
* 🛠️ Data Preprocessing:  Practice one-hot encoding and explore other data preprocessing techniques.
* 📈 Model Evaluation:  Learn how to evaluate model performance using metrics like MSE. 

🎉 Have Fun Learning!
